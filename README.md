# GitHub download

Because of the presence of the GFW, GitHub is not easy to use in where I am living.

For many times, I could access <github.com> coincidently, but it sucks when i download
some releases of some repo. It is said that GitHub releases are hosted on Amazon cloud,
with the domain name <raw.githubusercontent.com>.

Fortunately, there are many mirrors for use.

This is the project to make full use of these mirrors to download releases without
visiting <github.com> on the web, but in the terminal with [gh](github.com/cli/cli).
